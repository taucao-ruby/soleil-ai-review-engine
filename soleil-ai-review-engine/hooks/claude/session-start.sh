## soleil-ai-review-engine Code Intelligence

This codebase is indexed by soleil-ai-review-engine, providing a knowledge graph with execution flows, relationships, and semantic search.

**Available MCP Tools:**
- `query` — Process-grouped code intelligence (execution flows related to a concept)
- `context` — 360-degree symbol view (categorized refs, process participation)
- `impact` — Blast radius analysis (what breaks if you change a symbol)
- `detect_changes` — Git-diff impact analysis (what do your changes affect)
- `rename` — Multi-file coordinated rename with confidence tags
- `cypher` — Raw graph queries
- `list_repos` — Discover indexed repos

**Quick Start:** READ `soleil-ai-review-engine://repo/{name}/context` for codebase overview, then use `query` to find execution flows.

**Resources:** `soleil-ai-review-engine://repo/{name}/context` (overview), `/processes` (execution flows), `/schema` (for Cypher)
